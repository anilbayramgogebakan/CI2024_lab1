# CI2024_lab1
This repo is created for Lab 1 of Computational Intelligence course in Politecnico di Torino. Here are some highlights:

* The script is written by using jupyter notebook. However, some of the outputs havent run in advance since it takes a lot of time.

* For the first instance, since universe size and number of sets values are too small, the cost of new solution can vary a lot which is expected.

* The Hill climb method has been used for all instances.
